# ObjectView
ObjectView is a simple wireframe rendering application which takes an object description file with x-y-z coordinates for vertices, edge numbers for drawing faces, and rotation, transformation, and perspective parameters. 

ObjectView.py is written for the excellent Pythonista 3 IDE on iOS using the Pythonista canvas for graphics rendering, and ObjectViewMac.py is a version written for Python 3 on Mac OS or Linux, and uses tkinter canvas for graphics rendering. 

Here is a screenshot of the Pythonista IDE I used to write this:
